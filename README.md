## 1. 
Write a function
```javascript
function solution(N);
```
that, given an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), returns an array containing N distinct integers that sum up to 0. The
function can return any such array.

For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1, 0, −3, 2], and for N = 3 one of the possible answers is
[−1, 0, 1] (but there are many more correct answers).
